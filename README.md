*The social and linguistic dynamics of an on-line community.*

There is a theory in social science, that people adopt similar patterns of language use when they
interact. (See, for example, Gonzales et al.1) This assignment will investigate whether this concept
is evident for an online forum, where participants communicate with each other via conversations in
a thread. 

**Goals**
1. Investigate whether members who are communicating directly with each other (via threads) use similar language, which may be different to other members of the forum.

2. Investigate whether the language used changes over time. For example, does the proportion of language expressing optimism change?

**Data**
1. Data is taken from a real online forum and consists of the metadata and linguistic analysis of 20,000 posts over the years 2002 to 2011. The linguistic analysis was conducted using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), which assesses the prevalence of certain thoughts, feelings and
motivations by determining the proportion of key words in language. (see more at http://liwc.wpengine.com/wpcontent/uploads/2015/11/LIWC2015_LanguageManual.pdf)
